Shared Dependencies:

1. **React**: All the .tsx files will share the React dependency as they are written in JSX syntax which is a syntax extension to JavaScript and is used with React to describe what the UI should look like.

2. **Next.js**: All the .tsx files and the package.json file will share the Next.js dependency. Next.js is the framework that will be used for server-side rendering and routing.

3. **TypeScript**: All the .tsx files and the tsconfig.json file will share the TypeScript dependency. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types.

4. **Shadcn UI components**: The .tsx files will share the Shadcn UI components dependency as specified in the user's prompt.

5. **Portfolio Data**: The index.tsx and PortfolioItem.tsx files will share the portfolio data (the list of companies in the portfolio). This data might be stored in a separate file or fetched from an API.

6. **CSS Styles**: The .tsx files and the globals.css file will share the CSS styles. The styles defined in the globals.css file will be used across all the .tsx files.

7. **Public Assets**: The _document.tsx, Header.tsx, and Footer.tsx files will share the public assets (favicon.ico and logo.png). These assets will be used in the layout of the website.

8. **Custom Components**: The _app.tsx, index.tsx, and _document.tsx files will share the custom components (Header.tsx and Footer.tsx). These components will be used in the layout of the website.

9. **Function Names**: The .tsx files might share function names if there are common functionalities across the components. For example, a function to navigate to a portfolio item might be used in both the index.tsx and PortfolioItem.tsx files.

10. **DOM Element IDs**: The .tsx files might share DOM element IDs if there are elements that need to be accessed by JavaScript functions across different components. For example, a modal might have the same ID in both the index.tsx and PortfolioItem.tsx files.

11. **Message Names**: If the application uses a messaging system (like events or Redux actions), the .tsx files might share message names. For example, a "PORTFOLIO_ITEM_SELECTED" message might be used in both the index.tsx and PortfolioItem.tsx files.
